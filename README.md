# Filezorg
Filezorg automatically makes a folder every week so you can organize your files. This is just a project that I made to help organize *my* files and wanted to publish it in case anyone could make use of it.

#Install and setup
Step One: Clone this repository
mkdir filezorg
cd filezorg
git clone https://github.com/JuliusWon/Filezorg.git

Step 2: Add to crontab
To make the folder crontab must run this app on a set time. To do this:
run crontab -e
